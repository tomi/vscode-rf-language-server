Forward slashes can be used as path separators in all operating systems.\n\nIt is possible to pass arguments to the imported library and also named argument syntax works if the library supports it. `WITH NAME` syntax can be used to give a custom name to the imported library.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nImport Library  MyLibrary      \nImport Library  ${CURDIR}/../Library.py  arg1  named=arg2  \nImport Library  ${LIBRARIES}/Lib.java  arg  WITH NAME  JavaLib\n```"},{"name":"Import Resource","args":["path"],"doc":"Imports a resource file with the given path.\n\nResources imported with this keyword are set into the test suite scope similarly when importing them in the Setting table using the Resource setting.\n\nThe given path must be absolute or found from [search path](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#pythonpath-jythonpath-and-ironpythonpath).

They are off by default, but can be enabled by giving them a true value. See [Boolean arguments](#Boolean%20arguments) section for more information about true and false values.\n\nIf the `html` argument is given a true value, the message will be considered HTML and special characters such as `<` in it are not escaped. For example, logging `<img src=\"image.png\">` creates an image when `html` is true, but otherwise the message is that exact string. An alternative to using the `html` argument is using the HTML pseudo log level. It logs the message as HTML using the INFO level.\n\nIf the `console` argument is true, the message will be written to the console where test execution was started from in addition to the log file.

This is useful, for example, when working with strings or bytes containing invisible characters, or when working with nested data structures.

Both of these are defined in `*args` and must use exactly format `ELSE` or `ELSE IF`, respectively. ELSE branches must contain first the name of the keyword to execute and then its possible arguments. ELSE IF branches must first contain a condition, like the first argument to this keyword, and then the keyword to execute and its possible arguments. It is possible to have ELSE branch after ELSE IF and to have multiple ELSE IF branches.\n\nGiven previous example, if/else construct can also be created like this:\n\n```\n${status}  ${value} =  Run Keyword And Ignore Error  My Keyword    \nRun Keyword If  '${status}' == 'PASS'  Some Action  arg  ELSE  Another Action\n```\n\nThe return value is the one of the keyword that was executed or None if no keyword was executed (i.e. if `condition` was false). Hence, it is recommended to use ELSE and/or ELSE IF branches to conditionally assign return values from keyword to variables (to conditionally assign fixed values to variables, see [Set Variable If](#Set%20Variable%20If)). This is illustrated by the example below:\n\n```\n${var1} =  Run Keyword If  ${rc} == 0  Some keyword returning a value    \n...  ELSE IF  0 < ${rc} < 42  Another keyword    \n...  ELSE IF  ${rc} < 0  Another keyword with args  ${rc}  arg2\n...  ELSE  Final keyword to handle abnormal cases  ${rc}    \n${var2} =  Run Keyword If  ${condition}  Some keyword    \n```\n\nIn this example, ${var2} will be set to None if ${condition} is false.\n\nNotice that `ELSE` and `ELSE IF` control words must be used explicitly and thus cannot come from variables. If you need to use literal `ELSE` and `ELSE IF` strings as arguments, you can escape them with a backslash like `\\ELSE` and `\\ELSE IF`.\n\nStarting from Robot Framework 2.8, Python's [os](http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html) and [sys](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html) modules are automatically imported when evaluating the `condition`.

How long to retry running the keyword is defined using `retry` argument either as timeout or count. `retry_interval` is the time to wait before trying to run the keyword again after the previous run has failed.\n\nIf `retry` is given as timeout, it must be in Robot Framework's time format (e.g. `1 minute`, `2 min 3 s`, `4.5`) that is explained in an appendix of Robot Framework User Guide. If it is given as count, it must have `times` or `x` postfix (e.g. `5 times`, `10 x`). `retry_interval` must always be given in Robot Framework's time format.\n\nIf the keyword does not succeed regardless of retries, this keyword fails. If the executed keyword passes, its return value is returned.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nWait Until Keyword Succeeds  2 min  5 sec  My keyword  argument\n${result} =  Wait Until Keyword Succeeds  3x  200ms  My keyword\n```\n\nAll normal failures are caught by this keyword. Errors caused by invalid syntax, test or keyword timeouts, or fatal exceptions (caused e.g. by [Fatal Error](#Fatal%20Error)) are not caught.\n\nRunning the same keyword multiple times inside this keyword can create lots of output and considerably increase the size of the generated output files. Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, it is possible to remove unnecessary keywords from the outputs using `--RemoveKeywords WUKS` command line option.\n\nSupport for specifying `retry` as a number of times to retry is a new feature in Robot Framework 2.9. Since Robot Framework 2.9, variable errors are caught by this keyword."}]}
