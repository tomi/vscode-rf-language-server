## Version 2.2.0
* Release date: October 21, 2018

### What's new in this version
* Code completion support for standard and any 3rd party libraries.
  * Need to be configured in `rfLanguageServer.libraries`.
  * Standard libraries can be included by just configuring the library using its name and version. See a list of all available libraries [here](https://github.com/tomi/vscode-rf-language-server/tree/master/client#supported-standard-libraries).
  * Other libraries can be configured by specifying their keywords inline. See details [here](https://github.com/tomi/vscode-rf-language-server/tree/master/client#defining-3rd-party-libraries).
* As a consequence of this, code completion documentation now supports markdown. Meaning any markdown in keyword `[Documentation]` will be rendered properly in VS Code.
* A fix for bug that caused keywords being shown multiple times in the code completion list.

```json
